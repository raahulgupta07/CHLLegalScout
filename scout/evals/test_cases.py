"""
Test cases for evaluating Scout.

Each test case includes:
- question: The natural language question to ask
- expected_strings: Strings that should appear in the response
- category: Test category for filtering
- golden_path: Optional file path where the answer should be found

When golden_path is provided and --check-sources is enabled, the evaluation will:
1. Verify the agent cited the correct source document
2. Factor source citation into the pass/fail decision
